This Python script provides a simple way to fetch and display information about a GitHub user's repositories.

## How It Works

- The script defines three functions:
  - `fetch_user_repositories(gituser)`: Fetches repository data from the GitHub API for the specified username and returns a list of dictionaries containing details about each repository.
  - `display_repository_info(repositories)`: Takes the list of repository dictionaries and prints out details such as the repository name, description, URL, programming language, and the number of stars.
  - `main()`: Prompts the user to enter a GitHub username and then uses the other two functions to fetch and display the repository information.

When the script is run, it will ask for a GitHub username. Once provided, it will output a list of the user's repositories along with some key details.

## Future Evolution

While the script is currently a straightforward command-line application, there is potential for it to evolve into a more robust tool. Future enhancements could include:

- A GUI for a user-friendly experience.
- The ability to filter or sort repositories by language, number of stars, or other criteria.
- Integration with a database to store repository information for historical comparison or trend analysis.
- Extending functionality to include more GitHub data, such as commit history or contributor details.
